# FCS-YOLO
A new model for high precise multi-scale and subtle crack detection under complex backgrounds
The corresponding paper title for this project is “Spatial-Temporal Evolution of Landslide Cracks Revealed by UAV Photogrammetry: The FCS-YOLO Model for Precise Crack Extraction Under Complex Backgrounds ”.
In the future, various data and codes in the paper will gradually be opened up.
